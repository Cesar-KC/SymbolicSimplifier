This was the code generated from Claude AI when I first prompted it for how Racket is structured: 

(define (simplify expr)
  (cond
    [(number? expr) ...]  ; base case
    [(symbol? expr) ...]  ; base case (variable)
    [(list? expr) ...]    ; recursive case - apply rules
    ))


I used this as a base to create and build upon the four functions fold, reduce, canonical form, and simplify.
